    <h1>Meditation Guide for the Terminally Online Person</h1>
    <p>You are distracted.</p>
    <p>Your attention is one of your most valuable assets you have.</p>
    <p>Your attention is being stolen from you.</p>
    <p>I will try to teach you how to get it back.</p>
    <p>First, observe your mind with dispassion.</p>
    <p>What does this mean?</p>
    <p>This means to not react to thoughts that occur to you.</p>
    <p>Consider thoughts as if they were leaves floating by in a river.</p>
    <p>Acknowledge the thought, then let it go.</p>
    <p>What is the lesson to be learned?</p>
    <p>The lesson is that thoughts arise on their own.</p>
    <p>Observe and learn how the mind cogitates.</p>
    <p>Your thoughts arise from your body, from the accumulated set of sensations your body has experienced throughout its lifetime.</p>
    <p>The human brain is not located just within the skull. It is spread throughout the body through the central nervous system.</p>
    <p>All the sensations that a human being experiences shapes the brain by forming connections between synapses.</p>
    <p>What is interesting is when experiences are sensed within the brain itself. How does a synapse connect in reaction to synapses connecting?</p>
    <p>How does one record the experience of thinking about thinking?</p>
    <p>Let us change the topic.</p>
    <p>The task is to slow the constant stream of thoughts in order to learn how to focus on the most relevant thought.</p>
    <p>This skill can take a long time to learn and master.</p>
    <p>My advice is to practice silence.</p>
