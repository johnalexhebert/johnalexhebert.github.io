<p>People are uncomfortable with silence and must fill the space with words.</p>
<p>We are driven to distraction by our fear of silence. We are driven to name things and attempt to describe and understand that which we do not yet understand, thinking that will bring clarity, but it only brings complexity and further confusion. We are trying to understand silence.</p>

<ul>
<li>There is an answer.</li>
<li>There are words that heal.</li>
<li>There is a sentence that will bring you over to where you want to go, to bring you over the divide.</li>
<li>Consciousness does have a definition</li>
</ul>

We are biological beings driven by appetites. Our minds are driven by impulses we can barely control; food, sex, sleep. Evolution has not kept pace with culture. Our culture has outpaced our physiological evolution.

We are already where we want to be.<br>
What we are looking for is right in front of us, always.<br>
Where else would it be?<br>
We must live in the present to experience it.<br>
We must open our eyes and ears to it.<br>
It is all around us.<br>
We are already here.<br>
To live in the present we must first quiet the mind.<br>
We must learn to let go of attachments.<br>
We must learn to observe the mind with dispassion.<br>
When one has an angry thought, notice it and let it go.<br>
When one has a pleasant thought, notice it and let it go.<br>
When one can practice this without ceasing, one will attain liberation.<br>
Liberation means freedom from impulses of the mind on the body.<br>
The body is your teacher.<br>
Listen to it.<br>
