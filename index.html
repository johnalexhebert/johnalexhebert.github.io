It is written in the Book of Crom:
                                                                                   
After the Creation, the cruel god Moloch rebelled<br>
against the authority of Marduk the Creator.<br>
Moloch stole from Marduk the most powerful of all<br>
the artifacts of the gods, the Amulet of Yendor,<br>
and he hid it in the dark cavities of Gehennom, the<br>
Under World, where he now lurks, and bides his time.<br>

Your god Crom seeks to possess the Amulet, and with it<br>
to gain deserved ascendance over the other gods.<br>

You, a newly trained Plunderess, have been heralded<br>
from birth as the instrument of Crom.  You are destined<br>
to recover the Amulet for your deity, or die in the<br>
attempt.  Your hour of destiny has come.  For the sake<br>
of us all:  Go bravely with Crom!<br>
