Simplifying my life and living more minimally has been one of the best investments in my well-being. Maybe the best.
</p>
<p>
It took me a few years of intentionally living with less (and perhaps more isolation than necessary) but it has paid off. It required a lot of work and life style changes; a divorce from a dysfunctional marriage, changes in diet, getting rid of stuff I don't need. And meditation helped a great deal, though it may not work for you.
I can now chose whether or not to be angry or depressed when presented with a difficult challenge. I can now feel more satisfaction when presented with positive experiences. Overall, my mind is more calm than it has been in 40 years.

I don't know if anyone else will read this or take this advice seriously. Life does not have to be stressful and unsatisfying. It starts with living in the present moment.
