  <h1>How To Live</h1>
<h2>It is possible to wake up from the dream of your life.</h2>  
<p>
Simplifying my life and living more minimally has been one of the best investments in my well-being. Maybe the best.
</p>
<p>
It took me a few years of intentionally living with less (and perhaps more isolation than necessary) but it has paid off.
  It required a lot of work and life style changes; a divorce from a dysfunctional marriage, changes in diet, getting rid of stuff I don't need.
  And meditation helped a great deal, though it may not work for you.
I can now chose whether or not to be angry or depressed when presented with a difficult challenge.
  I can now feel more satisfaction when presented with positive experiences. Overall, my mind is more calm than it has been in 40 years.
</p>
<p>I don't know if anyone else will read this or take this advice seriously.
  Life does not have to be stressful and unsatisfying. It starts with living in the present moment.</p>

<p>
  What changed?
  <ul>
    <li>My inner dialogue stopped.</li>
    <li>My focus sharpened.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h4>Influential books</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Buddhism Without Belief by Stephen Batchelor
    <li>Waking Up by Sam Harris
  </ul>
  
<p>What was very helpful was to let go of Buddhism as a religious and spiritual practice and to focus instead on mindfulness and observation of thought.</p>

<h2>Observations</h2>
<h3>2024.01.16</h3>
<p>Observe the mind dispassionately while it perceives reality.</p>
<h3>2024.01.26</h3>
<p>Explore the present moment.</p>
<h3>2024.03.05</h3>
<p>Focus on the object of your intent.</p>
<h3>2024.03.06</h3>
<p>The self is a social construct.</p>
<h3>2024.03.09</h3>
<p>We are lost in thought for most of our lives. We are uncomfortable with silence. We are driven to name and understand, thinking that will bring clarity, but it only brings complexity and confusion.</p>
<h3>2024.03.23</h3>
<p>The present moment is the only experience that can be said to truly exist. All other experiences are either memories or expectations. We exist in a continually unfolding miracle.</p>
<h3>2025.03.29</h3>
<p>In every moment, we can make the choice to recognize and follow the path that is laid before us, or we can observe the universe unfold.</p>

  The Spilled Cup<br>
  by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Shabestari">Mahmoud Shabestari</a>
  The Universe: His wine cellar<br>
  the atoms heart; His measuring cup.<br>
  Intellect is drunk, earth drunk, sky drunk<br>
  Heaven perplexed with Him, restlessly seeking,<br>
  Love in its heart, hoping at least<br>
  for a single whiff of the fragrance<br>
  of that wine, that clear wine the angels drank<br>
  from that immaterial pot, a sip of the dregs-<br>
  the rest poured out upon the dust:<br>
  one sip, and the Elements whirl in drunken<br>
  dance<br>
  falling now into water, now in blazing fire.<br>
  And from the smell of that spilled cup<br>
  man rises from the dust and soars into Heaven.<br>
